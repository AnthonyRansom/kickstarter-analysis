# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the outcomes of the theater kickstart campaigns for each month of the year on order to provide insight into the time of year campaign generally succeed 
along with the outcome succes/failure rate based on the kickstarter goal.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch_Image](/resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)

From the kickstart campaing dataset and using the provided graph labeled "Theater outcomes Based on Launch Date" it was found 
that starting from the month of March the number of successful campaigns increased sharply until the Month of May where 
it was found the number of succesful campaign went into a decline.

looking at the same period the number of failed campaigns did not have any sharp increases and stayed consistent 
which would indicate the drop in successful campaigns would most likely not be due to campaigns 
not meeting the campain goals but just a general decrease in the number fo campaigns running during those periods.

This could also indicate a period during the year there is an increased willingness to pledge to kickstarter campaigns
It may be best to consider running a campaign during the increased amount of campaigns dur the Months of March to May may result in higher competietion
against other campaigns but running the campaign during other times of the year there may be decresed interest to pledge to campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
From the Outcomes based on goals graph it is clear the higher the funding the goal the more likely it is for the campaign to fail.
the majority campaigns that are successult have a funding goal up to 20,000 but there is an interesting funding goal of betwwen 35,000 and 40,000
that the number of succeful campaigns increases again.

it is advised against running a campaign for anything above 45,000 as the graph indicates the majority of campaigns asking for theat amount of funding
fail.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There were no major challenges found in the dataset but if the dataset indicated asome outliers from campaigns running with very high funding goals
it would have skewed the data and present the graphs in a less accurate manner.
There were some outliers in the percentage funded data which may have resulted in diffilculy running on an analysis of the average funding goal 
compared to how much was pledged.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
From the analysis of the outcomes based on launch date there are two conlusions:
 - There is an increase in the number of successful campaign between the month of March and May
 - During the decline of successful campaigns after the month of May the number of failed campaigns does not sharply increase 
   which would indicate there are less campaigns running during that period

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
From the analysis of the outcomes based on goals it is clear it would be safest to keep the funding goal below 15,000
but the data indicates an increase in successful campaigns between 35,000 and 40,000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
